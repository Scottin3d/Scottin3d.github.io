                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                My name is Scott Shirley.  I am a graduating senior at the University of Washington, Bothell studying computer science and software engineering.  I am passionate about technology and using as a tool to connect and empower individuals.
                </p>
                <br><h2>I am a student.</h2>
                <p>
                I recently finishing my last full quarter at the University of Washington, where I have been studying computer science and software engineering.
                I like to think of my self as a purpetual student or someone who is always learning.  I am curious person and love to learn how things work.  
                Whether it is something from the internet browsing TIL on Reddit or sitting in a formal lecture, I strive to learn something new everyday.
                <br><br>
                Especially during the stressful times of looking for a new job, reading job descriptions is daunting.  The tech stacks that exist are many and the specific ones I am familiar with are varying.  
                However, I am convinced that my eagerness and willingness to learn bridges the gap. And let's be honest, you'd be lying if you said you were proficeient in all of the current tech stacks that are used today.  
                </p><br>
                <br><h2>I am a tech junky.</h2>
                <br><h2>I am an artist.</h2>
                <p>
                From a very young age, I have always been creative.  As a kid I loved to build Lego and draw.  As I got older, I became more and more interested in the digital arts.
                I started making computer game mods as a teenager for games like Halo Custom Edition, Counter Strike, and Gary's Mod.  
                I really enjoyed 3d modeing and creating spaces to experience.
                After highschool, I followed my artist passions and attended Digipen Institute of Technology where I graduated with a bachelors of arts in digital art and animation.

                <br><h2>I am a Sailor.</h2>
                <p>
                After graduating from Digipen 2013, I enlisted into the US Navy as a Hospital Corpsman.  I served for five years out of Jacksonville, Florida and Camp Lejeune, NC.  While in Florida, I worked in the labor and delivery ward assisting with 
                newborn deliveries.  I deployed as a security detachment with 3d Battalion, 6th Marines in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  After returning and being promoted, I was the assisting work center supervisor, incharge of 26 junior enlisted Sailors.  Additionally, 
                I was responsible for the procurement and distribution of a $128k operations budget as well as responsible and accountable for over $1.49 million dollars worth of specialty medical equipment.  Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Florida recieved the Joint Commission Gold 
                Seal during the 2016 hospital-wide inspection.  In preparation for the inspection of our department, I led the audit of personnel records for 12 providers, 22 nurses, and 28 enlisted Sailors ensuring compliance with command, state, and federal training guidelines.
