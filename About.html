                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                My name is Scott Shirley.  I am a graduating senior at the University of Washington, Bothell studying computer science and software engineering.  I am passionate about technology and using as a tool to connect and empower individuals.
                </p>
                <br><h2>I am a student.</h2>
                <br><h2>I am a tech junky.</h2>
                <br><h2>I am an artist.</h2>
                <br><h2>I am a Sailor.</h2>
                <p>
                After graduating from Digipen Institute of Technology in 2013, I enlisted into the US Navy as a Hospital Corpsman.  I served for five years out of Jacksonville, Florida and Camp Lejeune, NC.  While in Florida, I worked in the labor and delivery ward assisting with 
                newborn deliveries.  I deployed as a security detachment with 3d Battalion, 6th Marines in support of Operation Inherent Resolve.  After returning and being promoted, I was the assisting work center supervisor, incharge of 26 junior enlisted Sailors.  Additionally, 
                I was responsible for the procurement and distribution of a $128k operations budget as well as responsible and accountable for over $1.49 million dollars worth of specialty medical equipment.  Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Florida recieved the Joint Commission Gold 
                Seal during the 2016 hospital-wide inspection.  In preparation for the inspection of our department, I led the audit of personnel records for 12 providers, 22 nurses, and 28 enlisted Sailors ensuring compliance with command, state, and federal training guidelines.
